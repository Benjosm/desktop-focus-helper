# Audio files (assets that should be committed)
# Assets are explicitly part of the project, so no need to ignore them

# Configuration files (should be committed if they are default configs)
# config.yaml is a default config, so it should not be ignored.

# Testing
# The verification steps mention `python focus_helper.py demo`, which is a test,
# but it doesn't generate any files that need to be ignored.
