\"\"\"desktop-focus-helper.monitor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Provides the skeleton for the ActivityMonitor class which will be
responsible for tracking user activity (keystrokes, mouse movement,
active window changes, etc.).  This file only defines the class
structure and the initialisation logic required by the current
task.  All runtime behaviour (polling, event handling, etc.) will
be added later.

class ActivityMonitor:
    \"\"\"Skeleton for monitoring desktop activity.

    The monitor tracks:
      * Keystroke count
      * Mouse movement count
      * The currently active window (placeholder)

    All attributes are initialised in ``__init__``; concrete
    monitoring logic will be implemented in later development tasks.

    def __init__(self, cfg: Dict[str, Any]):
        \"\"\"Create a new ``ActivityMonitor`` instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cfg : dict
            Configuration dictionary.  The only mandatory key for now
            is ``\"poll_interval\"`` which defines how frequently the
            monitor should poll for activity.  Additional keys may be
            added later.

        Notes
        -----
        * The dictionary is stored unchanged in
          ``self._cfg`` for later reference.
        * Two integer counters are created for keystrokes and mouse
          movements.  They are protected by ``self._lock`` to ensure
          thread‑safety when the monitor runs in a background thread.
        * ``self._active_window`` is initialised to ``None`` – the
          actual value will be populated by platform‑specific code.
        * ``self._stop_event`` signals a request to stop the monitor.
        * ``self._started_event`` indicates that the monitor has
          successfully started its background loop.
        * An informational log entry is emitted on creation.
